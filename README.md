# Polynomial regression

This project aims to experiment with the construction of n<sup>th</sup>-degree polynomials, such that they pass through a given set of points.

The program `main.py` outputs the equation of a polynomial that passes through every point in the list `points`, which is loaded from a JSON file named `points.json` (create locally).
